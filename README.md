- First phase: We coded together! by looking at one person build up the basic features.
- Second phase:
    - Can split the work
    - Every morning we coordinate and merge branches, resolve any conflicts
    - Used trello to keep track of where everyone is

# Installation instructions for any dependencies
- bundle install
- rails db:reset
- Create student and teacher accounts before getting started

# Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
- I am a teacher, and I want my students to do group work together effectively (even when they are remote)
- I am a teacher, and I need to keep track of my students' group work better
- I am a student, and I need to keep track of the tasks our group has to do
- I am a student, and I need a fun way/incentive to keep motivated
