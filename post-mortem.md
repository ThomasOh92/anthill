# Unit 3 Project Group 5 - Post Mortem

-------------------
## Approach and Process

### What in our process and approach to this project would we do differently next time?
- Plan out features and UI ahead of time (e.g some features were added during the development stage without proper wireframing and planning)

### What in our process and approach to this project went well that we would repeat next time?
- Daily stand-ups helped to align our work done as well as overcome any conflicts with merging of branches
- From there, daily we would allocate tasks to one another for features that are not overlapping
- Use of Trello board for task management was also essential in our workflow
-------------------

## Code and Code Design

### What in our code and program design in the project would we do differently next time?
- We opted to use inline CSS instead of adding rules to a stylesheet, as such it may have lead to a lot of repetition within the code
- We should have also commented as we went along rather than adding at the end of development
### What in our code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything we would do the same next time?
- Paper CSS framework was very aligned our app idea and as such we did not need to struggle with customising the aesthetics to suit the idea
- Coding style between members was similar enough that understanding each others code was not a challenge for us

## WDI Unit 3 Post Mortem (individual)

#### Rachel:
### What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- More productive, team work drives the motivation to keep moving and better time management.

### What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- Getting less errors that cost time and make comments so my team-mates can know the progress so it can reduce time lost to understand each other.

### How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
- It seems I just know the basic.

#### Thomas:
### What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- Relying on teamwork, team support, team pressure to be productive

### What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- Commenting on my code more often as a I go along

### How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
- Not too bad, although not sure why we broke up the lessons into so many tiny chunks. We didnâ€™t break it up as much during Unit 1 and 2.
Would have preferred to learn Django and Python

#### Azhar:
### What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- Team work makes the dream work
- Listening to team members ways of approaching problems help me to learn better practices as well

### What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- Not to throw away code too easily (almost rage quit early on)

### How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
- Covering ruby on rails pretty quickly, though initially did not like using the framework and syntax, it grew on me
- Maybe for future batches can explore another language and framework rather than ruby on rails (eg Python and Django)
